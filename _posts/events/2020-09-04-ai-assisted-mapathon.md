The MapGive team held a mapathon and partnered with Maxar to explore different AI technologies that can help make mapping easier and faster. In addition, our partner The President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has identified mapping needs around clusters of health facilities in Nigeria where filling in holes in the map with publicly accessible open data can help local humanitarian and development activities.
