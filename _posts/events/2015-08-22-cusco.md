August 22 to 23 in Cusco, Peru, as part of the collaboration between the National University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco and Secondary Cities Initiative. The participants were a mix of college students and professionals in the Peruvian government. The workshop introduced techniques for gathering field data in OpenStreetMap (OSM) using OpenMapKit and FieldPapers; OpenStreetMap editing; and using OpenStreetMap data in GIS; and focused particularly on areas of recent urban growth in Cusco.
