## What happened?

Forty-one students volunteered their time today for a “Mapathon” organized by the U.S. Consulate General in Lahore in collaboration with the Information Technology University Lahore. The students used “open mapping” technology to create maps of roads, bridges, and buildings that will assist international response efforts in Nepal in the wake of recent earthquakes. 

## What were the outcomes and how did they support engagement? What were the outputs and metrics?

In just three hours, these citizen cartographers edited more than 4,000 roads and buildings via online mapping software. The event gave Pakistani students an opportunity to interact with open mapping experts in Washington, D.C. and learn about the important relationship between maps and humanitarian aid. 

Post interacted with local youth. Public Affairs Officer had a time to explain the young students how United States is helping humanitarian efforts in the region and how students can participate right form their desks. The event helped in social media outreach activities of the post and resulted in huge youth engagement.
