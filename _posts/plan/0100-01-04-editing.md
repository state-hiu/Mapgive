### Saving Your Work

When you save your work, you’ll be prompted to enter a Commit Message, as shown in Figure 4 . Please enter a brief, but descriptive sentence on what features you entered.

Save edits often. Sometimes, when more than one person was editing the same feature, iD Editor will throw an error.

### Some general notes about data entry in OpenStreetMap

* We make use of the ID Editor in this Guide (although tagging concepts apply to the JOSM editor, as well). More advanced users may want to migrate to the JOSM editor at some point for improved editing efficiency or specialized needs (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM).
* If you’re familiar with Basic panning and editing functionality is similar to other GIS software.
* It is important to become familiar with the shortcuts associated with some of the more heavily used editing tools to expedite the process.
* In ID Editor, shortcuts are accessed by first clicking on the feature (which will be either a line or a point). This brings up several options to edit the feature. Available shortcuts are specified below each editing option on the editing wheel
