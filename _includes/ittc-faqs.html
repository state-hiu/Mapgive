        <p>MapGive utilizes satellite imagery when supporting OpenStreetMap mapping projects for humanitarian and development needs. High resolution imagery is key to mapping remotely in OpenStreetMap so that OSM users, like yourself, can see a clear picture of what's on the ground when you are editing in OpenStreetMap. To learn more about how to use satellite imagery to trace edits into OpenStreetMap, check out our how-to videos on our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/learn-to-map/" target="_blank">Learn to Map page</a>.</p>

        <p>As you may have noticed, there is already imagery available throughout OpenStreetMap. Since November 2010, Bing has allowed OpenStreetMap editors to trace from their aerial imagery for the purpose of contributing content to OpenStreetMap. For many mapping projects, the available imagery is often sufficient. Sometimes the area of interest is located in a gap where there is no good-quality imagery coverage. At other times, the available imagery may be outdated and newer imagery is needed to respond to a current event. This is when MapGive can help. </p>

        <p>If you have a humanitarian-based mapping project in need of up-to-date imagery, e-mail us at  <a href="mailto:mapgive@state.gov?Subject=IttC%20request" target="_top">mapgive@state.gov</a> and we can start the conversation! Be sure to include: The purpose, geographic extent, and timeframe of your imagery request.</p>

Please note: MapGive's ability to facilitiate Imagery to the Crowd services is subject to Departmental determination that the requested imagery meets certain criteria - particularly, a humanitarian need where mapping data is lacking. Those accessing imagery or imagery services must also accept the end user terms of the <a href="https://hiu.state.gov/Documents/NextView/USG_NextView_ImageryLicense.txt" target="_blank">NextView License Agreement</a>. Our ability to facilitate commercial imagery requests is also subject to to staffing and resource constraints.
