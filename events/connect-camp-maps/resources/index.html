<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Welcome to Community Mapping! Here are some first steps to get started before the ConnectCamp.</p>

<!-- This may be most easily organized by setting up a quick website, which could be done by MapGive team. (Is there a ConnectCamp website? No, but there are two sites we can embed info on: yali.state.gov and an internal site for MWF alumni (off of the alumni.state.gov site)) -->

<h3 id="start-learning">Start Learning</h3>

<p>Read and watch introductions on the MapGive Website.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mapgive.state.gov/why-map/">Why Map?</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/">Learn to Map</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="register-for-an-openstreetmap-account">Register for an OpenStreetMap account</h3>

<p>If there’s one thing you do before the Camp, register for an OpenStreetMap account. It takes just a few minutes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new">Sign Up</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed instructions on registration in part 1 of “Learn to Map”.</p>

<h3 id="walkthrough-the-id-editor">Walkthrough the iD editor</h3>

<p>The OpenStreetMap editor is called “iD”. On OpenStreetMap.org, search for your home town, and zoom in. Click “Edit”. The iD editor will take you through a tutorial.</p>

<p>More on this first step at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/welcome">OpenStreetMap Welcome</a></p>

<p>There are many more resources on this page, Case Studies and Guides. Dig in!</p>

### In Person

Prior to ConnectCamp, we may be able to find folks from the local OpenStreetMap, to share the process directly with facilitators. We could also arrange to do this via Hangout.
