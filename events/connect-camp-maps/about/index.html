<!-- What I like about this is the overlap with our design/ venture models: The questions are similar…. ex: What is the problem / opportunity? What data to collect? What means to collect (survey / imagery) etc? What is the resulting map project / service? How is it shared with community and other stakeholders? What resources are needed for each stage? -->
